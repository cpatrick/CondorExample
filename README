This repository is to serve as a very basic condor example. I use it for
testing a new high-throughput computing environment. To try it:

cmake . # I know in-source, but look at echo30.c, it's insignificant
condor_submit_dag try.dag

That's it. Use condor_status and condor_q to make sure everything is running
as it should.

Protip: condor_rm will remove a job that may have run away from you.
